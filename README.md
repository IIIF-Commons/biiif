<!-- ![IIIF Presentation API 3 compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/iiif--presentation--api-%3E=3-blue.png) -->

```bash

```bash
const { build } = require('biiif');
build('myfolder', 'http://example.com/myfolder');
```



Organise your files according to a simple [naming convention](https://github.com/edsilv/biiif#examples) to generate [IIIF](http://iiif.io) json.

Use [biiif-cli](https://github.com/edsilv/biiif-cli) to run from a terminal.

Note: This uses the [IIIF Presentation API v3](http://prezi3.iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/) (currently in alpha), but is compatible with the [Universal Viewer](http://universalviewer.io) v3 (in beta).

If you want to build a website with biiif, try [uv-app-starter](https://github.com/UniversalViewer/uv-app-starter) which comes with the [Universal Viewer](http://universalviewer.io) and biiif already set up.

## Conventions

A collection is a folder with sub-folders whose names _do not_ start with an underscore.

A manifest is a folder with sub-folders whose names _do_ start with an underscore.

A collection's sub-folders (no underscore) are treated as further nested collections.

A manifest's sub-folders (with underscore) are treated as canvases to add to the manifest.

Files within 'canvas folders' (.jpg, .pdf, .mp4, .obj) are annotated onto the canvas with a `painting` motivation.

## Annotations

IIIF Presentation 3.0 uses the [Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) to annotate canvases.

By default, biiif will annotate any files it finds in a canvas directory (except `info.yml` and `thumb.jpg`) onto the canvas with a `painting` motivation.

This is handy as a quick way to generate simple manifests. However, what if you want to annotate some text onto a canvas with a `commenting` motivation?

Or what happens when you have obj or gltf files that require image textures to be located in the same directory? You don't want these files to be annotated onto the canvas too!

This is where custom annotations come in. Just create a file `my-annotation.yml` in the canvas directory and set the desired properties in that.

For example, here is `my-comment.yml`:

```yml
motivation: commenting
value: This is my comment on the image
```

Here we've excluded the `type` (`TextualBody` is assumed), and `format` (`text/plain` is assumed).

What about the gltf example? Here's how `my-3d-object.yml` could look:

```yml
value: assets/myobject.gltf
```

Here we've excluded the `motivation` (`painting` is assumed), `type` (`PhysicalObject` is assumed), and `format` (`model/gltf+json` is assumed).

biiif knows that because it's a gltf file, it's likely to have all of the above values. You just need to include a `value` property pointing to where you've put the gltf file itself. In this case, an `assets` folder within the canvas directory. The associated image textures can live in the `assets` folder too, they won't get annotated unless you specifically ask for them to be.

## Metadata

To add metadata to your collections/manifests/canvases, include an `info.yml` file in the folder e.g.

```yml
label: The Lord of the Rings
description: The Lord of the Rings Trilogy
attribution: J. R. R. Tolkien
metadata:
    License: Copyright Tolkien Estate
    Author: J. R. R. Tolkien
    Published Date: 29 July 1954
```

## Thumbnails

To add a thumbnail to your collection, manifest, or canvas simply include a file named `thumb.jpg` (any image file extension will work) in the directory.

If no thumb image is found in a canvas directory, biiif checks to see if an image is being annotated onto the canvas with a painting motivation. If so, a thumb is generated (100 x 100px) from that.

## Linked Manifests

Often it's necessary to include IIIF manifests in your collection from elsewhere. To do this, include a `manifests.yml` file in your collection folder e.g.

```yml
manifests:
- id: http://test.com/collection/linkedmanifest1/index.json
  label: Linked Manifest 1
  thumbnail: http://test.com/collection/linkedmanifest1/thumb.jpg
- id: http://test.com/collection/linkedmanifest2/index.json
  label: Linked Manifest 2
- id: http://test.com/collection/linkedmanifest3/index.json
```

If you leave the `label` property blank, it will default to the name of the last folder in the `id` URL.

Including a `manifests.yml` file in a folder without any sub-folders forces it to behave like a collection.

## Examples

Here is an example of how to organise your files/folders for biiif.

This example only has a single root collection, but biiif will happily build collections to any nested depth. 

biiif will accept a manifest folder too, generating a single manifest `index.json`.

```yml
lord-of-the-rings                  // collection
â”œâ”€â”€ info.yml                       // collection metadata
â”œâ”€â”€ thumb.jpg                      // collection thumbnail
â”œâ”€â”€ 0-the-fellowship-of-the-ring   // manifest
|   â”œâ”€â”€ _page-1                    // canvas
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ page-1.jpg             // content annotation
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ thumb.jpg              // canvas thumbnail
|   |   â””â”€â”€ info.yml               // canvas metadata
|   â”œâ”€â”€ _page-2                    // canvas
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ page-2.jpg             // content annotation
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ thumb.jpg              // canvas thumbnail
|   |   â””â”€â”€ info.yml               // canvas metadata
|   â”œâ”€â”€ _page-n                    // canvas
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ page-n.jpg             // content annotation
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ thumb.jpg              // canvas thumbnail
|   |   â””â”€â”€ info.yml               // canvas metadata
|   â”œâ”€â”€ info.yml                   // manifest metadata
|   â””â”€â”€ thumb.jpg                  // manifest thumbnail
â”œâ”€â”€ 1-the-two-towers               // manifest
|   â”œâ”€â”€ _page-1                    // canvas
|   â”œâ”€â”€ _page-2                    // canvas
|   â”œâ”€â”€ _page-n                    // canvas
|   â”œâ”€â”€ info.yml                   // manifest metadata
|   â””â”€â”€ thumb.jpg                  // manifest thumbnail
â””â”€â”€ 2-the-return-of-the-king       // manifest
    â”œâ”€â”€ _page-1                    // canvas
    â”œâ”€â”€ _page-2                    // canvas
    â”œâ”€â”€ _page-n                    // canvas
    â”œâ”€â”€ info.yml                   // manifest metadata
    â””â”€â”€ thumb.jpg                  // manifest thumbnail
```
